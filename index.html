            <img src="images/balsamiq.ico" alt="Profile Picture" class ="profile-picture">
            <p>Hello! I'm Eric Li, a computing science major currently studying at Simon Fraser University.
               I love technology, problem-solving and working by myself or with others to create innovative
               solutions. Over the years, I've developed a strong foundation in programming, web and UX 
               design, front-end development, presentation skills, collaborating with others, working with
               real-world problems, understanding real user needs and challenges, and more. I have gained 
               experience in a variety of programming, presentation, teamwork, and design languages, tools, 
               frameworks, and skills, and I am always eager to continue improving.

               Outside of coding and schooling, I'm an artistic and adventurous person who is always looking
               to enjoy life to the fullest. I love being outdoors, travelling, exploring new cultures and
               places, and spending time with my friends and loved ones. I'm also a massive sports and fitness
               enthusiast, as well as a massive history aficionado, particularly ancient Greek history. I consider 
               myself a person with an artistic temperment, and I love to read, watch movies and TV, listen to music,
               appreciate photography, and writing. 
               
               In any facet of my life, I'm always lookign to learn new things, meet new people, and experience new 
               things. I'm always looking to grow, improve, and become the best version of myself that I can be. 
               Thank you for visiting my site!
