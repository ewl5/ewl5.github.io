My Own Personal Webpage.

License: AGPL-3.0 (From the License Test provided)

I chose this license because it's an open source license that allows modifications to be free and accessible. It also requires those using it share the source code. As this is my own webpage, I want it to be able to be used for community contribution while encouraging collaboration, transparency, and security practices. AGPL-3.0 supporting open development is also good because I as a student want to contribute to an open learning environment.
